<h2>Identifying AI Opportunities in Your Business</h2>

<p>To effectively implement AI, businesses must first identify areas where AI can deliver the most value. This involves a strategic assessment of existing processes and an understanding of how AI can enhance these operations. Let's explore some key areas where AI can be a game-changer.</p>

<h3>Customer Relationship Management</h3>

<p>AI can revolutionize customer relationship management by providing personalized experiences and proactive support.
