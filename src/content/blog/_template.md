## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this file** and rename it (use lowercase with hyphens, e.g., `my-new-blog-post.md`)
2. **Update the frontmatter** (the section between the `---` marks)
3. **Write your content** below the second `---`
4. **Save the file** in `src/content/blog/`
5. **Restart the dev server** or just refresh - Astro will auto-detect it!

That's it! Your blog post is now live.
