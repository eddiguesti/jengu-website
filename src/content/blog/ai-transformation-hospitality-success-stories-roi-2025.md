## Common Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: Choosing Generalist Consultants

**The Problem:** Generalist AI consultants lack hospitality expertise, leading to longer implementations and solutions that don't fit industry needs.

**The Solution:** Work with hospitality-specialized consultants like Jengu who understand guest experience, PMS integration, and industry-specific workflows.

### Mistake 2: Trying to Automate Everything at Once

**The Problem:** "Big bang" implementations overwhelm staff and guests, often failing before delivering value.

**The Solution:** Start with one high-impact area (usually guest communication), prove success, then expand.

### Mistake 3: Neglecting Staff Buy-In

**The Problem:** Staff who feel threatened by AI can sabotage implementations.

**The Solution:** Position AI as a tool that handles tedious work so staff can focus on meaningful guest interactions.

### Mistake 4: Set It and Forget It

**The Problem:** AI systems need ongoing optimization to maintain and improve performance.

**The Solution:** Choose a consultant who includes ongoing optimization in their engagement.

### Mistake 5: Focusing Only on Cost Reduction

**The Problem:** Pure cost-cutting AI implementations miss revenue opportunities and can harm guest experience.

**The Solution:** Balance efficiency with experience enhancement and revenue growth.
