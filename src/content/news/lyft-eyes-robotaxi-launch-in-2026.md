description: "Lyft is set to enter the autonomous vehicle market with the launch of its robotaxi fleet in Dallas as early as 2026, in collaboration with Intel's Mobileye and the Japanese conglomerate Marubeni. The initiative aims to rival Uber’s advancements with Waymo’s robotaxis while maintaining an \"asset-light\" approach by allowing partner companies to own and operate the vehicles. Marubeni will manage the fleet's operations, utilizing its extensive experience in fleet management and its Flexdrive technology to enhance cost-efficiency and vehicle utilization. This strategic partnership underscores Lyft’s commitment to establishing itself as a leading player in the burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry."

<h2>Lyft Set to Launch Robotaxi Fleet in 2026</h2>

<h3>Collaboration with Mobileye and Marubeni</h3>

Lyft has announced plans to deploy a fleet of robotaxis utilizing Intel's Mobileye self-driving technology in Dallas by 2026. The initiative will be supported by Japanese conglomerate Marubeni, which will oversee fleet operations, marking a significant step in Lyft's aim to expand its operations rapidly into new markets. The company plans to scale the fleet to thousands of vehicles shortly after the initial launch.

<h3>Competitive Moves in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry</h3>

The announcement from Lyft follows closely on the heels of Uber's recent declaration of its intention to integrate Waymo's robotaxis onto its platform in Austin and Atlanta by the end of the year. Additionally, Tesla has shared its plans to launch a similar service in Austin this summer. Both companies are competing vigorously to establish a strong foothold in the autonomous vehicle arena.

<h3>Lyft’s Strategy for Fleet Management</h3>

In drawing parallels to Uber's strategy, Lyft is focusing on maintaining an "asset light" approach. The company is leveraging its ride-hailing platform by collaborating with various self-driving technology developers rather than owning and maintaining the fleet directly. Marubeni will play a crucial role in this strategy by managing the fleet using its extensive global expertise, which includes over 900,000 vehicles worldwide across various subsidiaries and joint ventures.

<h4>Partnership with Marubeni</h4>

While Marubeni has limited direct experience with ride-hailing or autonomous vehicle operations, its collaboration with Mobileye in Japan on-demand mobility projects positions it as a strong partner for Lyft. David Risher, CEO of Lyft, stated, "They’re aiming to be leaders in the emerging AV space, and we look forward to working together."

<h3>Advancements in Autonomous Technology</h3>

The vehicles will be owned by Marubeni and equipped with Mobileye's cutting-edge technology. As an Intel-owned entity, Mobileye supplies advanced driver-assist systems to leading automakers, including Ford, Volkswagen, and Toyota, ensuring a high standard of technological integration in the robotaxi fleet.

<h3>Remaining Competitive in a Fast-Paced Market</h3>

Lyft's move marks a critical effort to stay competitive with its primary rival, Uber, which has already secured significant partnerships with Waymo, Aurora, Motional, and Avride. Although Lyft has previously contemplated developing its own autonomous vehicles, it ultimately sold its AV research and development division to a subsidiary of Toyota in 2021. The decision aligns with Lyft's strategic focus on partnerships to propel its autonomous vehicle ambitions forward.
