description: "In a major development, Humane has announced the shutdown of its underperforming AI Pin, selling the company’s assets and technology to HP for $116 million. This acquisition will see HP integrate Humane's CosmOS software and over 300 patents into their product lines, with Humane's team, including founders Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, joining HP's newly formed AI division called HP IQ. Initially hyped with high expectations and a $1 billion valuation, the AI Pin faced harsh criticisms and poor sales, leading to its eventual discontinuation. The device, which was meant to revolutionize wearable technology, will cease cloud functionality on February 28th, 2025. Customers are advised to retrieve their data before this date."

<h2>Humane Terminates AI Pin Line, Sells Assets to HP</h2>

<h3>HP Acquires Humane's Platform and Workforce for $116 Million</h3>

<p>Humane is set to cease operations of its AI Pin product, selling the bulk of its company to HP in a deal valued at $116 million. The announcement marks the end of the AI Pin's short-lived market presence, with existing units scheduled to lose core functionalities at 3 PM ET on February 28th, 2025.</p>

<h3>Impact on AI Pin Users</h3>

<p>The shutdown of the AI Pin will result in the loss of features like calling, messaging, AI interaction, and cloud services post-February 28th. Humane advises current users to back up photos, videos, and notes stored on their devices to prevent loss upon the server shutdown.</p>

<p>Refunds are only available for AI Pins returned within a 90-day window from the shipment date, with requests due by February 27th, 2025. Subscribers with fees extending beyond February 28th will receive a prorated refund. Meanwhile, customers awaiting replacements for the recalled charging cases are assured automatic refunds post the cut-off date.</p>

<h3>HP's Strategic Acquisition</h3>

<p>Through this acquisition, HP secures over 300 patents and various patent applications from Humane, along with the foundational CosmOS technology. The acquisition also brings the technical team from Humane, laying the groundwork for HP's new division aimed at advancing AI integration in their product lineup, titled HP IQ.</p>

<h4>Background on the AI Pin</h4>

<p>The AI Pin initially garnered attention with a TED demonstration but faced criticism post-launch in April 2024. Reviews generally highlighted its functionality issues, leading to poor sales and subsequent price cuts in October 2024. Despite attempts to reposition CosmOS as a compatible operating system for a broad array of devices, Humane's efforts did not foster a successful market presence for the AI Pin.</p>

<h3>Transition for Humane's Team</h3>

<p>With the acquisition, Humane's founding members, including Imran Chaudhri and Bethany Bongiorno, will join HP to spearhead the new HP IQ division. This initiative is expected to foster an AI-driven ecosystem across HP's range of computing, printing, and conferencing products.</p>

<p>HP's integration of Humane’s technology and team underscores a strategic push towards bolstering AI capabilities across its platforms, aligning with the company's vision for the modern workplace.</p>

<p>The dissolution of Humane’s AI Pin line concludes a chapter of ambitious, albeit short-lived, technological innovation amidst evolving AI and automation landscapes.</p>
