OmniHuman: Advancing Realistic Human Video Generation Through Multi-Condition Training

Introduction to OmniHuman

The realm of realistic human video generation has witnessed a groundbreaking innovation with the introduction of OmniHuman, a cutting-edge framework designed by Bytedance researchers Gaojie Lin, Jianwen Jiang, Jiaqi Yang, Zerong Zheng, and Chao Liang. This revolutionary model supports the synthesis of human videos from a single image, utilizing diverse motion signals such as audio, video, or a combination thereof. The primary breakthrough with OmniHuman lies in its multimodality motion conditioning mixed training strategy, enabling the framework to excel where previous models struggled due to limited high-quality data availability.

OmniHuman's Core Features

OmniHuman is equipped to handle various visual and audio styles, prioritizing realism through detailed motion, lighting, and texture. Its versatility extends to images of any aspect ratio, be they portrait, half-body, or full-body, producing exceptionally lifelike results. Furthermore, the simplicity of its operation—requiring only a single image and audio to generate its outputs—underscores its user-friendly nature. While reference images are largely omitted for layout clarity, they are typically represented by the inaugural frame of generated videos.

Applications in Singing and Talking

The OmniHuman model shines in diverse applications, including singing and talking scenarios. For singing, it adapts to multiple music styles and body poses, ensuring fluid motion even in high-pitched songs. Users can expect enhanced video quality correlating with the reference image quality. When it comes to talking, OmniHuman adeptly manages any aspect ratio input while significantly improving gesture realism compared to existing technologies.

Embracing Input Diversity

OmniHuman accommodates a wide range of input varieties, from cartoons and artificial objects to animals and challenging poses. This capability ensures that the motion characteristics are true to the style's inherent features, providing a comprehensive animation experience.

Portrait and Half-Body Case Studies

The framework also demonstrates impressive results across portrait aspect ratios using samples from CelebV-HQ datasets. Moreover, it showcases intricate gesture movements through half-body cases with input sources such as TED, Pexels, and AIGC, highlighting its capacity to replicate subtle movements with high fidelity.

Compatibility with Video Driving

Thanks to its mixed condition training approach, OmniHuman is adept at supporting not just audio-driven but also video-driven animations, mimicking specific actions from video references. Its versatility extends to synchronized audio and video driving, offering granulated control over individual body parts.

Ethical Considerations

The research team has prioritized ethical considerations, ensuring that demo images and audio are either publicly sourced or generated by models. These materials serve to demonstrate OmniHuman's capabilities responsibly. In cases where ethical concerns arise, stakeholders are encouraged to contact the team for prompt resolution.

Citation and Further Research

Researchers and practitioners who find OmniHuman instrumental in their work are invited to cite the associated papers. The bibliographic entries for further reading are thoughtfully curated to support ongoing research in this vibrant field.

By leveraging innovative strategies, OmniHuman sets a new standard in the realistic generation of human videos, promising exciting developments in human animation models.
