<h1>IRS Deploys AI Tools to Combat Emerging Tech's Role in Fraud Schemes</h1>

<p>In an era where artificial intelligence is reshaping the landscape of criminal activity, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is leveraging cutting-edge AI tools to confront the growing sophistication and volume of fraud schemes. Recognizing the dynamic threats posed by emerging technology, the IRS is making significant strides to enhance its investigative capabilities.</p>

<h2>Combating Advanced Fraud Techniques</h2>

<p>As criminals adopt AI technologies to execute sophisticated fraud schemes, the IRS's Criminal Investigation (CI) division is strategically using artificial intelligence to stay ahead. Jarod Koopman, Executive Director of Cyber and Forensics at IRS CI, highlighted the escalating challenge, noting the rise of online payment and check fraud. With criminals deploying AI to automate fraudulent activities, the IRS is bolstering its defenses against these digital threats.</p>

<h3>The Role of Artificial Intelligence</h3>

<blockquote>
  "What used to take a significant amount of effort, going into some type of a social media-type exploit or a hack, they can now do this with AI that’s much more efficient, much more effective, and certainly much more volume at high speed," Koopman stated.
</blockquote>

<p>Koopman emphasized that the IRS CI division is not yet utilizing AI in tax recovery operations but is actively exploring its application in various investigative scenarios. He underscored the importance of implementing AI solutions in a manner that upholds privacy and integrity.</p>

<h2>Navigating the Cryptocurrency Challenge</h2>

<p>The global cryptocurrency landscape presents additional challenges for federal law enforcement, offering avenues for fraudsters to obscure illicit revenue. The IRS CI division is tasked with navigating this complex environment, while also tackling diverse criminal activities ranging from public corruption to terrorism funding.</p>

<blockquote>
  "From a general standpoint, we’ve seen not only fraud continue on the rise, but more sophisticated frauds in the way of AI, cyber components, in addition to traditional financial fraud," Koopman noted.
</blockquote>

<h2>Building a Robust Investigative Workforce</h2>

<p>Despite being the sixth-largest federal law enforcement agency, the IRS CI division faces staffing limitations compared to larger agencies. However, its size allows for agility and innovation, crucial attributes in countering sophisticated fraud. The division has recently expanded, recruiting experts in international banking, anti-money laundering, and emerging technologies.</p>

<h3>Leveraging Data for Proactive Detection</h3>

<p>The IRS is utilizing AI to maximize the utility of its vast data resources, including operational data from previous cases and third-party inputs. These tools enhance the agency’s ability to detect patterns, identify fraud methodologies, and anticipate threats.</p>

<blockquote>
  "It's like having AI and large language models be able to match up against our data internally to be able to give us the results and the outputs that we’re looking for to make decisions," Koopman explained.
</blockquote>

<p>Additionally, privacy-enhancing technologies are enabling secure data sharing with partners, further safeguarding sensitive information from criminal exploitation.</p>

<h2>A Future in AI-Driven Enforcement</h2>

<p>As the IRS continues to build its AI capabilities, it aims to enhance its ability to detect and prevent financial crimes, promising a future where advanced technology serves as a pillar of law enforcement efficacy. With these advancements, the IRS stands poised to uphold tax law integrity against the challenges posed by artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies.</p>
