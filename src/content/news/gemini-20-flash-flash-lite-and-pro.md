<h2>Gemini 2.0: Unveiling Flash, Flash-Lite, and Pro</h2>

<h3>Overview of Gemini 2.0 Enhancements</h3>

On February 5, 2025, Google announced the expansion of the Gemini 2.0 family, offering new opportunities for developers and production applications. The latest updates are accessible through the Gemini API via Google AI Studio and Vertex AI. The new range includes Gemini 2.0 Flash, Flash-Lite, and an experimental release: Pro.

<h3>Introducing the Gemini 2.0 Models</h3>

<h4>Gemini 2.0 Flash</h4>
Now generally available, Gemini 2.0 Flash offers enhanced rate limits and improved performance with a streamlined pricing structure. It continues to provide robust support for a variety of applications, accommodating diverse developer needs.

<h4>Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite</h4>
This variant, available in public preview, aims to be the most cost-efficient model in the Gemini series. It is particularly optimized for large-scale text output applications, providing a more economical solution for developers.

<h4>Gemini 2.0 Pro</h4>
The Pro model, an experimental update, enhances coding capabilities and handles complex prompts, positioning it as the most advanced model in the Gemini suite to date.

These models, alongside the recently launched Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental, extend Gemini's capabilities to a wide array of uses and applications.

<h3>Model Features and Performance</h3>

<h4>Features</h4>
Gemini 2.0 Flash introduces several key features, including native tool use, a 1 million token context window, and multimodal input capabilities. Presently, it supports textual output, with future plans to include image and audio outputs via the Multimodal Live API.

<h4>Performance</h4>
Gemini 2.0 models demonstrate substantial performance enhancements over the Gemini 1.5 series, across multiple benchmarks. The Flash variant is designed for cost-efficiency, offering a concise output by default that can be expanded with prompts for better results in chat-oriented scenarios.

<h3>Gemini 2.0 Pricing</h3>

The pricing model for Gemini 2.0 simplifies cost management, with a single price per input type for both Flash and Flash-Lite. This approach eliminates the Gemini 1.5 distinction between short and long context requests, potentially reducing costs despite performance enhancements.

<h4>Getting Started</h4>
Developers can easily integrate these new models with just four lines of code, benefiting from an industry-leading free tier and scalable rate limits. For further details on token counting, Gemini Developer API pricing, and Vertex AI pricing, additional resources are available. 

Google encourages developers to advance their projects using these updated tools, expressing enthusiasm for future innovations enabled by Gemini 2.0.
