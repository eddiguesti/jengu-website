<h1>AI Creators You Need to Know</h1>

<p>In the rapidly evolving era of artificial intelligence, trust has emerged as the cornerstone of innovation, driving transformative narratives across industries. As AI continues to redefine the landscape of technology and business, Edelman presents a pioneering list, AI Creators You Need to Know. This groundbreaking compilation features 50 meticulously vetted and brand-safe AI creators who are spearheading the global dialogue on artificial intelligence. These individuals, spanning academia, professional realms, and creative sectors, bring unparalleled expertise and credibility to the narrative of AI advancements.</p>

<h2>Building Trust in AI</h2>

<p>Edelman’s 2024 Trust Barometer highlights a crucial insight: nearly two-thirds of the population believes that innovation is poorly managed, underscoring a burgeoning demand for transparency and trust in technological development. Notably, individuals—particularly experts and creators—are increasingly trusted, with 74% of respondents expressing more trust in "people like me" than in traditional institutions. This trend underscores the pivotal role creators will play in crafting authentic and human-centered AI narratives.</p>

<blockquote>"With trust and innovation at the heart of today’s brand strategies, the AI Creators You Need to Know list offers a unique resource for brands aiming to engage audiences authentically, build trust, and localize their AI initiatives." — Edelman</blockquote>

<h2>Global AI Innovators</h2>

<p>From ethicists influencing policy to creators simplifying generative AI, these trusted voices are laying the groundwork for transformative collaborations in 2025 and beyond. This list serves as an invaluable resource for brands, offering insights and connections to trusted creators across various regions including the USA, APAC, Canada, EMEA, LATAM, UAE, and the UK.</p>

<h3>Methodology Behind the AI Top Voices List</h3>

<p>Edelman employs a comprehensive multi-criteria approach to identify and evaluate influencers for its prestigious AI Top Voices list. This process defines an ideal AI influencer profile characterized by recognized authority, a global B2B focus, and a significant reach, especially in key markets like the USA, UK, APAC, and the Middle East. Selection criteria include both quantitative and qualitative metrics, ensuring a minimum engagement rate of 2% and prioritizing platform relevance, notably LinkedIn and YouTube as primary B2B buyer channels. The methodology also emphasizes alignment with critical AI domains, such as generative AI, AI ethics, and enterprise-focused innovation.</p>

<p>Through a proprietary vetting matrix, influencers are assessed on metrics of credibility, value alignment, engagement, reach, and topical authority. This is complemented by an AI-powered conflict assessment analysis, resulting in a bespoke Trusted Creator Score. The higher the score, the greater the alignment with Edelman’s standards, underscoring the creators' potential to enhance Edelman's commitment to credibility and trust within the evolving AI discourse.</p>
