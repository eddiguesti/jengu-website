<p>Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, asserts that the integration of AI tutors is a significant step towards enhancing human capability rather than replacing it. While addressing concerns about potential job displacement due to AI, Huang affirms that AI will serve as a powerful tool to augment human capabilities.</p>

<h3>The Future of Learning and Work</h3>
<p>In a recent dialogue with journalist Cleo Abram, Huang revealed his reliance on personal AI tutors and emphasized their educational potential.

He cited AI platforms like Grok and ChatGPT as pivotal to democratizing learning, enabling users to access a vast array of knowledge seamlessly.</p>

<h4>The Vision for AI in Education</h4>
<p>Huang suggests AI can revolutionize education by offering personalized tutoring experiences, tailored to individual learning preferences. He encourages widespread adoption, stressing that AI can facilitate learning across various disciplines and boost problem-solving skills.</p>

<h3>Reassuring the Workforce: AI as an Enabler</h3>
