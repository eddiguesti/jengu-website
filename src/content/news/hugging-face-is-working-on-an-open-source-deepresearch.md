description: "Hugging Face is pursuing an open-source initiative to develop an \"agentic framework\" similar to OpenAI's Deep Research, which enhances LLMs' performance in complex tasks like those measured by the GAIA benchmark. This framework allows LLMs to execute actions, such as web browsing, using tools developed in code for greater efficiency. The initial open-source system achieved a validation score of 54%, demonstrating potential improvements through community collaboration. Hugging Face invites contributions to refine this framework and explore GUI agents further."

Title: Hugging Face Develops Open-source DeepResearch

Introduction  
In a groundbreaking move, Hugging Face is innovating open-source tools to rival OpenAI's recent release of Deep Research, a powerful system designed to browse the web, summarize content, and answer questions. This article delves into the mechanics of Deep Research, its performance on the General AI Assistants (GAIA) benchmark, and Hugging Face's ambitious efforts to build an open framework.

Understanding Agent Frameworks  
Agent frameworks serve as a crucial layer atop Language Learning Models (LLMs), enabling them to execute structured actions such as web browsing and document reading. These frameworks orchestrate operations into systematic steps, significantly enhancing the LLMs' functionality. By integrating LLMs into agentic frameworks, these systems can exhibit profound capabilities, as evidenced by performance boosts of up to 60 points on certain benchmarks. Hugging Face aims to replicate and enhance OpenAI's success by developing its own open-source agentic framework.

The GAIA Benchmark  
GAIA stands as a formidable benchmark for evaluating agent systems, encompassing complex, multi-layered questions that challenge LLM-based systems. For instance, questions may require multimodal capabilities, such as identifying items in an image, retrieving specific historical data, and synthesizing disparate information into cohesive answers. The complexity of these tasks makes GAIA an excellent metric for assessing the efficacy of agent frameworks like Deep Research, which has outperformed standalone LLMs significantly, achieving remarkable results on the public leaderboard.

Building an Open-source Deep Research  
Hugging Face's initiative focuses on developing a robust, open-source alternative leveraging a "code agent." Code agents encode actions as concise sequences of code, offering substantial advantages over traditional JSON-based actions, including efficient performance, significant cost reductions, and enhanced handling of state in multimodal tasks. Inspired by Microsoft's Magentic-One agent, Hugging Face is crafting essential tools, such as simplified web browsers and text inspectors, to propel their agent framework forward.

Results and Achievements  
Hugging Face's initial attempts have yielded promising results, showcasing a consistent improvement in performance on the GAIA benchmark. The adoption of code-based actions has propelled their agent's success rate from 46% to 54% on the validation set, a testament to the potential of this emerging technology. This achievement marks a critical step in realizing a fully open-source Deep Research platform, paving the way for enhanced community contributions and further innovation.

Community Contributions and Future Directions  
Beyond Hugging Face's efforts, the broader community has also engaged in creating open implementations of Deep Research, using diverse libraries and models. These efforts underscore the collaborative spirit driving advancements in AI technology. Moving forward, Hugging Face is committed to refining its web browsing capabilities and developing GUI agents—sophisticated systems that can interact with user interfaces through direct manipulation. The company is actively seeking community contributions and recruiting a dedicated engineer to help spearhead these initiatives.

Conclusion  
Hugging Face's endeavor to build an open-source Deep Research framework marks a significant stride toward democratizing access to advanced AI tools. By fostering community collaboration and leveraging cutting-edge technologies, Hugging Face aims to empower individuals and organizations to deploy powerful, customized agentic systems locally. As these developments unfold, they promise to reshape the landscape of AI research and application, offering unparalleled opportunities for innovation in the field.
