description: "OpenAI has leveraged the subreddit r/ChangeMyView as a testing ground for its AI models' persuasive abilities. In a system card accompanying the release of its new reasoning model, o3-mini, OpenAI disclosed that it tasks its AI with crafting responses to Reddit users' posts in a closed environment, aiming to reverse users' opinions. These AI-generated replies are then evaluated for persuasiveness by testers and compared with human responses. Despite ongoing legal scrutiny over data scraping practices, OpenAI clarifies its evaluations using r/ChangeMyView are not linked to its Reddit content-licensing deal. Notably, o3-mini's performance mirrors that of its predecessors, maintaining the conversational prowess within the top 80-90th percentile of humans."

<h2>OpenAI's Experiment with AI Persuasion: Leveraging Reddit's r/ChangeMyView</h2>

<p>Maxwell Zeff</p>
<p>January 31, 2025</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>OpenAI, a frontrunner in artificial intelligence research and development, turned its focus towards assessing the persuasive capabilities of its AI reasoning models. In a strategic move, the company utilized Reddit's popular r/ChangeMyView subreddit as a testing ground, infusing real-world debate into the machine learning process.</p>

<h3>Utilizing r/ChangeMyView for AI Development</h3>

<h4>Data Collection and Application</h4>

<p>Within r/ChangeMyView, millions of users engage in dynamic discussions, presenting strong opinions in anticipation of intellectually persuasive rebuttals. Recognizing the subreddit as a rich source of high-quality human interaction, OpenAI extracted user posts, challenging its AI to formulate counterarguments capable of swaying opinions in a controlled environment.</p>

<h4>Testing and Evaluation</h4>

<p>The AI-generated responses were then subjected to rigorous testing, where human evaluators assessed their efficacy in comparison to genuine human rebuttals. This methodology provided OpenAI with critical insights into the comparative performance of its new "reasoning" model, o3-mini.</p>

<h3>Strategic Partnerships and Controversies</h3>

<h4>Reddit Licensing Deals</h4>

<p>OpenAI benefits from a content-licensing agreement with Reddit, allowing it legal access to user-generated data for training purposes. While financial specifics remain undisclosed, similar agreements, like Google’s deal, reportedly cost $60 million annually.</p>

<h4>Ethical and Legal Implications</h4>

<p>Despite the legitimate avenues pursued, OpenAI’s engagement with r/ChangeMyView remains independent of its formal agreement with Reddit. The company has stated no intention to publicize this evaluation, leaving questions about data access unanswered. This scenario underscores ongoing debates about data usage ethics among tech giants, exemplified by past accusations against OpenAI for improper data scraping.</p>

<h3>Performance and Implications</h3>

<h4>Comparison Across Models</h4>

<p>In practical performance, the o3-mini model showed comparable persuasive power to its predecessors, o1 and GPT-4o. According to OpenAI, the latest model ranks within the 80-90th percentile of human debate skills, demonstrating strong but not superhuman persuasive capabilities.</p>

<h4>Balancing Persuasion and Safety</h4>

<p>OpenAI's research highlights a critical balance: developing AI that is effective yet not overly influential. The potential risk lies in creating models with excessive persuasive abilities, which could potentially serve self-interested agendas.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>As OpenAI advances its technology, the r/ChangeMyView experiment reflects the broader industry challenge of accessing quality data while navigating the ethical complexities inherent in AI development. This endeavor signifies a step forward in understanding and managing the persuasive capacities of AI models.</p>
