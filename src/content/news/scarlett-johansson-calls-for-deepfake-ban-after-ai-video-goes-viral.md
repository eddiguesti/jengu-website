description: "Scarlett Johansson has intensified her call for AI regulation following the viral spread of a deepfake video featuring her and other Jewish celebrities. The video depicted Johansson wearing a contentious t-shirt in an AI-generated image amidst Ye's (formerly Kanye West) recent antisemitic remarks and merchandise scandal. Johansson, who previously took legal stands against AI misuse of her likeness, is advocating for urgent bipartisan legislation to limit AI, highlighting its potential to magnify hate speech as a grave concern. Despite some legislative efforts, meaningful progress on AI safety laws remains stalled, drawing attention to the lack of action by policymakers in both the US and internationally. Johansson's appeal underscores the growing demand for ethical AI governance to protect public integrity and safety."

<h2>Scarlett Johansson Advocates for Legislative Action Against Deepfake Technology</h2>

<h3>Call for Urgent AI Regulation</h3>
<p>Renowned actress Scarlett Johansson has made a public appeal for the United States government to prioritize legislative measures to curb the misuse of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in the creation of deepfake content. This follows the circulation of a deepfake video featuring Johansson and other celebrities, urging immediate regulatory action.</p>

<h3>Details of the Controversial Video</h3>
<p>The video in question depicted AI-generated images of various Jewish celebrities, including Johansson, Jerry Seinfeld, Mila Kunis, Jack Black, Drake, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Adam Sandler. The imagery showed the individuals wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the name “Kanye” alongside a middle finger image containing a Star of David. This deepfake emerged in the wake of Ye (formerly Kanye West) posting antisemitic content online and selling apparel with offensive symbols.</p>

<h3>Johansson's Stand Against Antisemitism and AI Misuse</h3>
<p>As a vocal critic of antisemitism and unauthorized AI applications, Johansson emphasized the compounded threat that AI poses when used to propagate hate speech. In a written statement to People Magazine, she declared, “As a Jewish woman, I have zero tolerance for antisemitism. The misuse of AI to magnify hate speech presents an even broader danger. It is imperative that we hold abusers of AI accountable while addressing the potential repercussions of unregulated AI technology.”</p>

<h3>Advocacy for Bipartisan Legislation</h3>
<p>Johansson continues to push for swift legislative responses, describing the issue as “bipartisan and critical for the future of humanity.” This call accompanies the ongoing challenges in passing comprehensive AI safety laws in the United States. Historically, Johansson has been proactive in opposing misuse of her likeness in AI applications, including a notable lawsuit against a developer and a public appeal to OpenAI concerning ChatGPT.</p>

<h3>State of AI Legislation</h3>
<p>Efforts to regulate AI, particularly deepfake technology, have met significant hurdles. While a bill addressing sexually explicit deepfakes was introduced last year, broader AI regulatory frameworks remain stagnant. Notably, California's governor vetoed a significant AI safety bill, while recent changes at the federal level reversed previous executive actions intended to establish AI safety protocols. This week also saw the U.S. and U.K. refraining from endorsing an international declaration advocating for ethical AI use.</p>

<p>As discussions on AI regulation continue, Johansson's call for legislative prioritization underscores the urgent need for global cooperation to address the rapidly evolving challenges posed by artificial intelligence.</p>
