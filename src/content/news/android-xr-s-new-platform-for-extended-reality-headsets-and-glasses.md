<h1>Android XR: New Horizons for Extended Reality Headsets and Glasses</h1>

<p><em>Date: December 12, 2024 | Reading Time: 3 minutes</em></p>

<p>In a strategic partnership with Samsung and Qualcomm, a groundbreaking development has emerged: the launch of Android XR. This innovative platform heralds a new era of extended reality (XR) technology, poised to redefine the way we explore, connect, and create.</p>

<h2>Pioneering the Future of Computing</h2>

<p>The vision behind Android began over a decade ago with the ambition to revolutionize computing for everyone. As Android has transcended mobile phones to power a diverse range of devices—from tablets to cars—this technology continues to evolve. The next frontier is here, driven by advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), making computer interaction more intuitive and conversational than ever before.</p>

<h3>Empowering XR Devices</h3>

<p>Join us in unveiling Android XR, a state-of-the-art operating system crafted for the latest wave of computing technology. Fruitful collaboration with Samsung has been pivotal in integrating AI, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR) to enhance user experiences on XR devices such as headsets and glasses.</p>

<blockquote>"We’re building an ecosystem of developers and device makers for Android XR, all while maintaining the foundation that brought Android to billions." - Shahram Izadi, VP & GM, XR</blockquote>

<p>Today's announcement offers a developer preview backed by robust support frameworks, including ARCore, Android Studio, Jetpack Compose, Unity, and OpenXR. Qualcomm partners like Lynx, Sony, and XREAL are invited to embark on this journey, exploring the boundless potential of Android XR devices tailored to satisfy both individual and business needs.</p>

<h2>Seamlessly Merging Technology with Daily Life</h2>

<p>Android XR promises a transformative impact, beginning with headsets that revolutionize viewing, working, and exploring. The initial device, Project Moohan, a creation by Samsung, will make its market debut next year.</p>

<p>These headsets facilitate a dual experience, seamlessly transitioning between immersive virtual environments and the real world. Gemini, our AI assistant, enhances interaction by intuitively understanding user intent, thus enabling seamless planning, research, and guided task execution.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the reinvention of beloved Google applications for headset usage is underway. Users will enjoy watching YouTube and Google TV on virtual big screens, reliving memories via Google Photos in 3D, and embarking on exploratory journeys with Google Maps' Immersive View.</p>

<blockquote>"Experience the seamless integration of apps with Android XR, from everyday favorites to new immersive content exclusively crafted for XR." - Jengu.ai Technology Expert</blockquote>

<h3>The Future of Wearable Technology</h3>

<p>The capabilities of Android XR will soon extend to glasses designed for everyday wear. These stylish, comfortable glasses offer a seamless connection with other Android devices, positioning the power of the Gemini assistant just a tap away. By delivering information directly within the user's line of sight, navigation, translations, or message summaries become effortlessly accessible.</p>

<h2>Shaping the XR Ecosystem</h2>

<p>Designed to be an accessible, open platform, Android XR provides users with a choice of devices and continues supporting their favorite applications. For developers, this platform represents an opportunity to innovate across a spectrum of devices using familiar tools and frameworks.</p>

<p>We invite developers, device manufacturers, and creators to join us in crafting the future of computing. Developers can now access resources through the Android Developers Blog, with device availability updates to follow in the coming year.
