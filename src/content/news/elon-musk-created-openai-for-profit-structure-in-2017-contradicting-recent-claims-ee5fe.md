subtitle: "An insightful look into 'Elon Musk Created OpenAI For-Profit Structure in 2017, Contradicting Recent Claims'"
description: "In a recent revelation that challenges previous narratives, it has come to light that Elon Musk played a pivotal role in establishing OpenAI's for-profit structure as early as 2017. This development contradicts Musk's recent statements, suggesting his disapproval of OpenAI’s venture into commercial pursuits. Initially founded as a non-profit organization with the mission of ensuring artificial intelligence benefits all humanity, OpenAI's shift towards a \"capped-profit\" model raised eyebrows within the tech community. The 2017 transition allowed for attracting capital while maintaining a social mission, but Musk's involvement then was not widely publicized until now. This insight casts new light on the strategic directions and internal decisions that have shaped OpenAI's journey in the tech industry."
