<h1>Surrey Pioneers AI for Instant Image Creation on Standard Computers</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The University of Surrey's People-Centred Artificial Intelligence Institute has unveiled NitroFusion, a groundbreaking AI model that facilitates near-instant image creation on consumer-grade hardware. This technological advancement, developed by the SketchX Lab within the Institute, represents a significant leap forward in democratizing access to AI-driven creativity.</p>

<h2>An Innovative Solution for Creative Professionals</h2>
<p>NitroFusion's open-source availability marks a transformative step in making AI accessible to creative professionals, eliminating the necessity for large, costly computational resources typically required by similar technologies. Professor Yi-Zhe Song, Co-Director of the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI, highlights how this development empowers individual creators and small studios to achieve rapid artistic iterations and increased control over imagery.</p>

<blockquote>"Typically, similar technology is available only to corporate giants with vast computing resources. However, NitroFusion runs on a single consumer-grade graphics card – marking a decisive step forward in bringing advanced AI capabilities to individual creators, small studios, and educational institutions." – Prof. Yi-Zhe Song</blockquote>

<h2>The Technology Behind NitroFusion</h2>
<h3>Dynamic Adversarial Framework</h3>
<p>NitroFusion employs a novel dynamic adversarial framework, analogous to a panel of specialized art critics, ensuring high-quality output in a single step. Users can adjust the balance between speed and image quality by selecting between one to four refinement steps, offering unparalleled flexibility.</p>

<blockquote>"With NitroFusion, we're not just releasing another image generation model – we're pioneering an entirely new approach which democratizes AI interaction." – Dar-Yen Chen, PhD Researcher</blockquote>

<h2>A Commitment to Democratization and Innovation</h2>
<p>The release of NitroFusion accompanies a broader mission of democratizing AI tools, evident in last year's DemoFusion that upscaled AI-generated images. This approach aligns with the Institute's vision of inclusive and sustainable AI solutions, as emphasized by Professor Song.</p>

<blockquote>"This breakthrough delivers multiple leaps for users and industry: instant image generation, improved sustainability with reduced energy consumption, and the elimination of cloud dependencies and fees. Our Institute will continue to develop open-source, groundbreaking technologies." – Prof. Yi-Zhe Song</blockquote>

<h2>Expanding the Reach of AI</h2>
<p>NitroFusion is available globally with accessible documentation and community support. It underscores the Surrey Institute for People-Centred AI's dedication to placing individuals and society at the forefront of AI innovation. This people-centered ethos drives their research, marrying AI technology with real-world needs.</p>

<blockquote>"We're particularly proud of the great work done by our SketchX Lab, advancing the science of generative AI and ensuring that its future is inclusive, responsible, and accessible." – Prof. Adrian Hilton</blockquote>
