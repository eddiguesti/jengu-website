LLMs don't match keywords; they interpret meaning. They surface the clearest, most semantically rich explanation.

## The Problem with Current Content

Most blog posts are written for humans browsing, not AI scanning. AI needs:
- Clear answer in first 50 words
- Question-based headings
- Bullet points and lists
- Modular, liftable sections
