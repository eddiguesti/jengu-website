### GA4 Setup

**Create AI traffic segment:**

1. Go to GA4 → Admin → Data Streams

```
AI Search Traffic:
- Source contains "chat.openai"
- Source contains "perplexity"
- Source contains "claude"
- Source contains "bard"
- Source contains "bing" (Copilot)
```

**Or use regex in Reports:**
```
Source matches regex: (chat\.openai|perplexity|claude|bard)
```

### Track Conversions from AI

Set up conversion events:
- Demo bookings
- Contact form submissions
