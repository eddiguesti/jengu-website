# Step 8: Entity Building (Become THE Authority)

## Why This Matters

> "LLMs prioritize recognized entities. The key is to build an entity rather than purely targeting keywords."
> — Powered by Search

Google and LLMs understand "entities" — people, companies, and concepts. If Jengu.ai becomes a recognized entity in "hotel AI," you'll rank everywhere.

---

## What is an Entity?

An entity is something Google/LLMs recognize as a "thing" with attributes:
- A company
- A person
- A product
- A concept

**Entity attributes:**
- Name
- Description
- Relationships (founder, industry, location)
- Associated topics
- Sentiment

## Building Jengu.ai as an Entity

### Step 1: Claim All Properties

**Official presences to establish:**

| Platform | Status | Action |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Google Business Profile | [ ] | Create/claim |
| LinkedIn Company Page | [ ] | Optimize |
| Crunchbase | [ ] | Create profile |
| Wikipedia (when notable) | [ ] | Wait for notability |
| Wikidata | [ ] | Create entry |
| Google Knowledge Panel | [ ] | Earn through authority |

### Step 2: Consistent NAP+E

**NAP+E = Name, Address, Phone, Entity**

Use EXACT same info everywhere:
- **Name:** Jengu.ai (or "Jengu" consistently)
- **Description:** "AI automation for tourism and hospitality"
- **Industry:** Hospitality Technology / AI
- **Location:** [Your location]
