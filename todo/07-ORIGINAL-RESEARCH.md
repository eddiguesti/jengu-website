# Step 7: Original Research & Data

## Why This Matters

> "Models can't run surveys or crunch fresh numbers. If you provide that data, it gives the model a reason to reference your page."
> — Surfer SEO

Original research is the ultimate LLM citation magnet. If you're the source, you get cited.
