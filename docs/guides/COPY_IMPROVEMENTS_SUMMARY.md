**6-10 Essential FAQs (LLM & SEO Friendly):**

**Q1: What is an AI agent for tourism businesses?**
A: An AI agent is custom software that uses artificial intelligence to handle specific tasks automatically—like answering booking inquiries, processing reservations, managing customer support, or syncing data between your systems. Unlike generic chatbots, Jengu's AI agents are built specifically for your tourism business, trained on your services, policies, and guest data to provide accurate, personalized responses 24/7.

**Q2: Which types of tourism companies does Jengu work with?**
A: We work with hotels, resorts, boutique accommodations, campsites, holiday parks, tour operators, travel agencies, DMCs (Destination Management Companies), and activity providers across the UK, Europe, and beyond. Any tourism business that handles bookings, customer inquiries, or repetitive admin work can benefit from AI automation.

**Q3: What tasks can Jengu's AI agents automate?**
A: Common automation tasks include:
- Booking inquiries and reservations (web, WhatsApp, phone, email)
- Customer support and FAQ responses (24/7, multi-language)
- Email management and categorization
- Booking confirmations and reminders
- Pre-arrival and check-in communications
- Review requests and follow-ups
- Data entry and system synchronization
- Dynamic pricing adjustments
- Inventory and availability management

**Q4: How long does it take to go live with AI automation?**
A: Most projects go from initial consultation to live deployment in 2-6 weeks, depending on complexity. Simple chatbots and email automation can launch in 2-3 weeks. Custom software and complex API integrations typically take 4-6 weeks. Unlike enterprise software implementations, we focus on fast deployment with immediate results.

**Q5: What systems can you integrate with?**
A: We integrate with most tourism technology systems via API, including:
- Property Management Systems (PMS)
- Booking engines and channel managers
- CRMs (Customer Relationship Management)
- Email platforms (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Payment processors
- Accounting software
- Review platforms
- Communication tools (WhatsApp Business API, SMS gateways)

If a system doesn't have an API, we can often build custom integrations using webhooks, data scraping, or middleware solutions.

**Q6: How do you measure the ROI of AI automation?**
A: We track ROI through three key metrics:
1. **Time Savings:** Hours saved per week on repetitive tasks (typically 40+ hours)
2. **Revenue Increase:** More bookings from 24/7 availability and faster responses (up to 30% improvement)
3. **Cost Reduction:** Lower labor costs from automation (varies by business size)

Use our ROI calculator to see your specific potential savings based on your current operations. Most clients see 300-500% ROI within their first year.

**Q7: Do AI agents replace staff or support them?**
A: AI agents support your staff, not replace them. They handle repetitive, time-consuming tasks (routine inquiries, data entry, confirmations) so your team can focus on high-value activities—complex guest needs, personalized service, upselling, and creating memorable experiences. Many tourism businesses use AI automation to avoid hiring additional admin staff as they grow.

**Q8: What if the AI agent doesn't know how to answer a question?**
A: Our AI agents are designed with intelligent escalation. If a question is too complex, requires human judgment, or falls outside the AI's training, it automatically routes the conversation to your team with full context. This ensures guests always get accurate answers while your staff only handles questions that truly need human expertise.

**Q9: Is my guest data secure?**
A: Yes. We implement bank-level security:
- AES-256 encryption for data at rest
- TLS 1.3 encryption for data in transit
- GDPR compliance built-in
- Data stored in EU/UK/US regions (your choice)
- Regular security audits
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Role-based access controls

**Q10: How much does AI automation cost?**
A: Pricing varies based on your specific needs—complexity of AI agents, number of integrations, and custom features required. Most projects range from £[X] to £[Y] with clear, transparent quotes before we start. We focus on measurable ROI: if automation saves you 40 hours weekly at £15/hour, that's £2,400/month in value—typically 3-10x the cost of the solution. Use our calculator for a personalized estimate.
