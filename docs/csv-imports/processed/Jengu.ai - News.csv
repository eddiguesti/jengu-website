Unlike its predecessor AlphaFold, which focused on predicting protein structures, ProtGPS uses deep-learning to determine not only how proteins are constructed but also where they reside within cellular compartments. This knowledge is crucial as it could substantially impact the development of new drugs by offering insights into the cellular dynamics of diseases. The tool's ability to decode the molecular code governing protein localization could allow scientists to engineer proteins with precise destinations, offering new possibilities for correcting protein mis-localization linked to conditions such as cancer. Developed by researchers including Henry Kilgore and Itamar Chinn, ProtGPS is anticipated to","# AI Unveils Hidden Rules of Cellular Interior Design

The unveiling of a pioneering deep-learning model promises to transform the landscape of drug discovery and biotechnology. This development highlights the intersection of artificial intelligence and biological sciences, providing new insights into the spatial organization within cells.

## Uncovering Cellular Organization: The Role of Deep Learning

### A Breakthrough in Protein Localization

In a remarkable advancement, a team of researchers has developed a deep-learning model named ProtGPS, capable of predicting the sorting and localization of proteins within cellular environments. Historically, AI contributions in biology, like the Nobel Prize-winning AlphaFold, have concentrated on predicting protein structures. ProtGPS, however, extends capabilities by accurately determining the destinations of proteins within the cell, factoring in both typical and disease-related mutations.

According to Henry Kilgore, a chemical biologist at the Whitehead Institute in Cambridge, Massachusetts, knowing a protein's destination complements understanding its structure, deeply influencing its cellular functions and interactions. These revelations offer profound potential for drug development, allowing insights into how proteins can be engineered for targeted cellular locations.

## Mapping the Cellular Terrain: ProtGPS's Innovations

### From Structure to Function

Proteins mapped by tools like AlphaFold resemble instructions for assembling furniture, conveying shape but not placement or functional roles within the cellular ""room."" ProtGPS bridges this gap by assigning proteins to precise cellular locations, including biomolecular condensates, dynamic clusters that play vital roles in gene regulation and stress response.

While some proteins possess well-defined destinations, others navigate the cell’s vast open environment through subtler cues. ProtGPS decodes these intrinsic rules, identifying specific amino acid sequences that determine protein localization, which in turn affects gene regulation and disease progression.

### The Language of Proteins: Teaching AI New Vocabulary

ProtGPS utilizes a machine-learning framework originating from Meta’s ESM model (Evolutionary Scale Modeling), which efficiently extracts patterns from protein sequences. Unlike AlphaFold, which relies on detailed 3D structural predictions, ProtGPS leverages sequence patterns, enabling faster and larger-scale analysis.

Researchers employed ESM's architecture to uncover and learn intricate signals embedded in amino acid sequences. This empowers ProtGPS to predict protein assembly sites and guide the creation of novel proteins, enhancing cellular function or addressing mis-localizations linked to diseases.

## Challenges and Opportunities in AI-Driven Biology

### Deciphering the Complexity

ProtGPS's capacity to predict protein sorting, despite its success, poses the classic ""black box"" challenge inherent to AI systems—where the underlying logic isn't always transparent. Researchers, including Itamar Chinn and Ilan Mitnikov, worked diligently to unravel these predictions, though the complete biochemical rationale remains elusive.

### Shaping the Future of Drug Discovery

ProtGPS signifies a major leap toward fine-tuning protein localization and designing therapies for conditions like cancer. Dewpoint Therapeutics, a biotech firm, is already planning to integrate ProtGPS into its drug discovery efforts. Chief Scientific Officer Isaac Klein hailed the tool as transformative in identifying drug targets and crafting new therapies.

Tuomas Knowles from Transition Bio, a company targeting diseases at the level of protein condensates, further emphasized the importance of ProtGPS's discovery, underscoring prospects for addressing protein mis-localization—a root cause of numerous diseases.

## Conclusion: Redefining Cell Biology with AI

The advent of ProtGPS revolutionizes our understanding of cellular organization, illuminating the nuanced relationship between a protein's structure and its cellular distribution. As scientists continue to decode the biological architecture, AI-driven tools like ProtGPS serve not only as interpreters of molecular organization but also as architects shaping future biomedical innovations.

Through ProtGPS, we gain insights into nature’s blueprint, holding potential for unprecedented innovations in drug design and cellular biology, where molecule placement is as fundamental as their shapes.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672916ba596e9ad764eea6e4/67ab1f52927f715bd116e449_tmp935tu6s_.png,,spectrum.ieee.org,Tue Feb 11 2025 10:58:21 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,A visually stunning main image for the article: AI Reveals Hidden Interior Design Rules of the Cell

These errors underline the potential pitfalls of AI-generated summaries, prompting Apple to stress that users can disable this feature or adjust settings for specific apps. The move aims to enhance transparency and prevent further contradictions to original content, reinforcing Apple's commitment to refining its AI capabilities.","<h1>Apple to Enhance AI Summaries Following Erroneous BBC Headline Edits</h1>

<p>Apple has announced forthcoming updates to its AI-powered notification summaries after receiving criticism regarding inaccurate headline modifications sourced from BBC content. This decision comes amid growing concerns about the reliability of Apple's AI capabilities in automatically summarizing notifications.</p>

<h2>Background on the Issue</h2>

<p>In December, the beta version of Apple's AI summarization feature was launched in the UK, but quickly faced issues when it inaccurately altered a BBC headline relating to a UnitedHealthcare shooting suspect. The AI system erroneously suggested that the BBC reported Luigi Mangione had inflicted harm upon himself, leading to significant misinterpretation.</p>

<h3>Additional Reporting Errors</h3>

<p>Further compounding the issue, Apple's notification summaries also mistakenly announced a PDC World Darts Championship winner prematurely and inaccurately claimed Rafael Nadal had publicly disclosed his sexuality—none of which were reflected in the original BBC reports.</p>

<blockquote>""These AI summarisations by Apple do not reflect – and in some cases completely contradict – the original BBC content,"" comments the BBC.</blockquote>

<h2>Apple's Response</h2>

<p>Addressing these concerns, Apple has stated, ""A software update in the coming weeks will further clarify when the text being displayed is summarization provided by Apple Intelligence."" This update aims to maintain transparency, ensuring users can discern when AI technology has modified text content.</p>

<h3>User Options and Control</h3>

<p>Apple has reiterated that AI-generated summaries are an optional feature, granting users the ability to disable the function or customize which apps employ it through the Settings menu under Notifications &gt; Summarize Notifications.</p>

<blockquote>Apple Intelligence has had its amusing moments, but there have also been some alarming missteps, as exemplified by summarizing a message stating “that hike almost killed me” into “attempted suicide.”</blockquote>

<h2>Looking Forward with AI</h2>

<p>For experts and organizations like Jengu.ai, specializing in automation, AI, and process mapping, Apple's challenges underscore the complexities involved in leveraging AI for accurate content summarization. The discrepancies seen in Apple's current technology demonstrate the need for continual refinement and testing to avoid misinterpretations and ensure AI systems can reliably replicate the nuances of human communication.</p>

Musk has hinted at withdrawing the offer if OpenAI remains a nonprofit, stirring speculation about his true intentions. This high-stakes proposal not only places economic pressure on OpenAI but also casts","<h2>Elon Musk's Proposal to Acquire OpenAI: Five Key Insights</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
A consortium led by Elon Musk's x.AI recently made headlines with an audacious $97.4 billion offer to purchase OpenAI. This proposal, however, faces significant hurdles as OpenAI's CEO, Sam Altman, and his team remain firmly resistant. Amidst ongoing litigation over OpenAI's potential shift from nonprofit status, Musk's bid adds another layer to an already complex legal landscape.

<h3>The Core of the Offer</h3>

<h4>Set Deadline for Decision</h4>
The bid from Musk's consortium carries an expiration date of May 10, 2025. This can be extended should certain conditions be met, including prior mutual termination of discussions or a formal written refusal from OpenAI's board. Although Altman humorously countered with an offer to buy Musk’s X for a fraction of the proposed amount, OpenAI's board has yet to officially reject the bid, necessitating thorough consideration due to fiduciary duties.

<h4>A Commitment to All-Cash Transaction</h4>
The consortium, which includes prominent investors such as Joe Lonsdale's 8VC and Vy Capital, has pledged a full cash payout of the $97.375 billion offer. This marks a departure from Musk's past reliance on debt financing, such as the $13 billion borrowed for his acquisition of Twitter (rebranded as X) in 2022. Despite his substantial net worth, Musk's approach to this deal incorporates backing from multiple investors, indicating this is not a solo financial venture.

<h4>Demands for Due Diligence</h4>
A key component of the proposal demands extensive due diligence. Musk's team seeks comprehensive access to OpenAI’s financial records, assets, and personnel for evaluation. While standard in any large transaction, this due diligence phase raises concerns about potential exposure of sensitive business information to x.AI, an OpenAI competitor.

<h3>Potential Legal Implications</h3>

<h4>Contradictory Legal Stance</h4>
Musk's offer seems to conflict with his existing lawsuit aimed at preventing OpenAI’s transition to a for-profit entity. OpenAI's legal representatives argue the proposal undermines Musk's case by implying the startup’s assets can, in fact, be transferred for private gain. The consortium, however, maintains that profits from the acquisition would empower the nonprofit to further its mission.

<h4>Conditional Withdrawal Stipulation</h4>
In a new twist, Musk's legal counsel has signaled that they would retract the offer if OpenAI opts to retain its nonprofit status. This move is seen by some observers as a strategic ploy to elevate the eventual cost for Altman should OpenAI transition to a private company.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
As the situation unfolds, Musk's high-stakes bid for OpenAI adds layers of intrigue to the technological and financial sectors. With legal arguments mounting and the deadline approaching, the outcome remains uncertain. This scenario underscores the complexities of corporate acquisitions in the rapidly evolving AI industry.

This legal battle, supported by the youth advocacy group Encode, escalates concerns about OpenAI diverging from its foundational mission of safety and public benefit. Encode's amicus brief argues that OpenAI's potential restructuring into a Delaware public benefit corporation could compromise its safety commitments and public accountability. Hinton emphasized that allowing such a transition undermines non-profit commitments and sets a troubling precedent in the AI industry. Meanwhile, OpenAI contends that Musk lacks standing and accuses him of seeking advantages for his own enterprise, xAI, by","<h1>Godfather of AI Supports Elon Musk's Legal Challenge Against OpenAI</h1>

<p>In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, a significant legal battle is taking shape. A pivotal player in this unfolding saga is none other than Geoffrey Hinton, a luminary in the realm of AI, who has expressed his unequivocal support for Elon Musk’s lawsuit aimed at preventing OpenAI from transitioning into a fully for-profit entity.</p>

<h2>Key Players and Supporters</h2>

<p>The lawsuit, which seeks a preliminary injunction against OpenAI's proposed corporate restructuring, finds support from a diverse and influential coalition. Most notably, Geoffrey Hinton, a Nobel and Turing awardee, known as the ""godfather of AI,"" has aligned himself with Musk's cause. Additionally, the youth advocacy organization Encode has filed an amicus brief backing Musk's legal challenge, underscoring the widespread concern surrounding OpenAI's strategic shift.</p>

<blockquote>
    “OpenAI was founded as an explicitly safety-focused non-profit and made a variety of safety-related promises in its charter,” said Hinton in a statement through Encode. “Allowing it to tear all of that up when it becomes inconvenient sends a very bad message to other actors in the ecosystem.”
</blockquote>

<h2>Concerns Over OpenAI’s Corporate Shift</h2>

<p>OpenAI, currently structured as a for-profit company under a non-profit board, imposes certain limitations on its financial and operational activities. The announcement of its plans to become a full-fledged for-profit corporation has elicited both anticipation and apprehension across the AI community. The lawsuit, initiated by Elon Musk, challenges this prospect, arguing it could undermine the original safety-centric commitments upon which OpenAI was established.</p>

<h3>The Role of Encode</h3>

<p>The involvement of Encode, an organization representing youth interests globally, adds a significant dimension to the discussion. Their brief argues that transforming into a Delaware public benefit corporation contradicts OpenAI's public commitments of prioritizing safety over competition in developing artificial general intelligence.</p>

<blockquote>
    “Today, a handful of companies are racing to develop and deploy transformative AI, internalizing the profits but externalizing the consequences to all of humanity,” stated Sneha Revanur, Encode’s president and founder. “The courts must intervene to ensure AI development serves the public interest.”
</blockquote>

<h2>OpenAI's Response</h2>

<p>In response to the legal action, OpenAI has urged the court to dismiss Musk’s claims, describing them as an attempt to gain undue competitive leverage for his AI enterprise, xAI. The company has released emails and internal communications suggesting that Musk himself previously advocated for a for-profit model as early as 2017, further complicating the narrative.</p>

<h2>Implications for the AI Industry</h2>

<p>The lawsuit and subsequent reactions highlight the ongoing tensions between ethical considerations and commercial interests in the AI sphere. As experts in automation, AI, and process mapping, Jengu.ai continues to monitor these developments closely, recognizing their potential impact on the future of AI governance and public trust.</p>

The initiative aims to rival Uber’s advancements with Waymo’s robotaxis while maintaining an ""asset-light"" approach by allowing partner companies to own and operate the vehicles. Marubeni will manage the fleet's operations, utilizing its extensive experience in fleet management and its Flexdrive technology to enhance cost-efficiency and vehicle utilization. This strategic partnership underscores Lyft’s commitment to establishing itself as a leading player in the burgeoning autonomous vehicle industry.","<h2>Lyft Set to Launch Robotaxi Fleet in 2026</h2>

<h3>Collaboration with Mobileye and Marubeni</h3>

Lyft has announced plans to deploy a fleet of robotaxis utilizing Intel's Mobileye self-driving technology in Dallas by 2026. The initiative will be supported by Japanese conglomerate Marubeni, which will oversee fleet operations, marking a significant step in Lyft's aim to expand its operations rapidly into new markets. The company plans to scale the fleet to thousands of vehicles shortly after the initial launch.

<h3>Competitive Moves in the Autonomous Vehicle Industry</h3>

The announcement from Lyft follows closely on the heels of Uber's recent declaration of its intention to integrate Waymo's robotaxis onto its platform in Austin and Atlanta by the end of the year.

Marubeni will play a crucial role in this strategy by managing the fleet using its extensive global expertise, which includes over 900,000 vehicles worldwide across various subsidiaries and joint ventures.

<h4>Partnership with Marubeni</h4>

While Marubeni has limited direct experience with ride-hailing or autonomous vehicle operations, its collaboration with Mobileye in Japan on-demand mobility projects positions it as a strong partner for Lyft. David Risher, CEO of Lyft, stated, ""They’re aiming to be leaders in the emerging AV space, and we look forward to working together.""

<h3>Advancements in Autonomous Technology</h3>

The vehicles will be owned by Marubeni and equipped with Mobileye's cutting-edge technology. As an Intel-owned entity, Mobileye supplies advanced driver-assist systems to leading automakers, including Ford, Volkswagen, and Toyota, ensuring a high standard of technological integration in the robotaxi fleet.

<h3>Remaining Competitive in a Fast-Paced Market</h3>

Lyft's move marks a critical effort to stay competitive with its primary rival, Uber, which has already secured significant partnerships with Waymo, Aurora, Motional, and Avride.

This innovative move, spearheaded by Meta's VP of generative AI, Connor Hayes, will introduce AI characters that mimic real user profiles with bios, photos, and the ability to create and share AI-driven content. This strategic shift is aimed at capturing the digital-native younger demographic, as outlined by CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision where AI gradually transforms social media landscapes. Following the acquisition of Social.ai, a platform known for AI-user interaction, Meta is leveraging AI to redefine user engagement and social automation, diverging from the traditional model of friend-centric communities. The industry's anticipation now turns to how users will respond","<h1>Meta to Integrate Millions of AI-Generated Users on Instagram and Facebook</h1>

<p>By Colin Kirkland, January 2, 2025</p>

<p>Meta Platforms Inc. is poised to transform the social media landscape with a revolutionary initiative involving artificial intelligence (AI). Reports from the Financial Times indicate that the tech behemoth plans to introduce millions of AI-generated personas on its flagship platforms, Facebook and Instagram. This move aims to reshape how billions of users interact within these digital social spaces.</p>

<h2>Strategic Integration of AI</h2>

<p>Connor Hayes, Vice President of Product for Generative AI at Meta, outlined the company's vision: ""We expect these AIs to actually, over time, exist on our platforms, kind of in the same way that accounts do,"" he stated in an interview with the Financial Times. He elaborated that these AI personas will possess distinctive bios and profile images, capable of content generation and sharing, driven by cutting-edge AI technology.</p>

<h2>Revolutionizing Social Media's Demographics</h2>

<p>Meta's decision to incorporate AI-generated personas is strategically aligned with its ambition to captivate a younger, tech-savvy demographic. Unlike traditional views of bots as nuisances on social platforms, this new wave of non-human users is designed to enhance engagement rather than detract from it.</p>

<blockquote>CEO Mark Zuckerberg has earlier emphasized, ""Every part of what we do is going to get changed in some way [by AI]."" Highlighting a shift towards AI in social content, Zuckerberg foresees friend-content feeds evolving to host a substantial amount of AI-generated content.</blockquote>

<h2>Leveraging Expertise and Acquisitions</h2>

<p>Meta's strategic acquisition of Social.ai and collaboration with its creator, Michael Sayman, have underpinned the company's capabilities in developing these innovative generative AI features. This development marks a significant step towards integrating AI more deeply within their social media applications.</p>

<h2>Anticipating User Engagement</h2>

<p>The introduction of AI-generated personas presents both opportunities and challenges. Historically, bots have posed hurdles by spreading unsolicited content and distorting advertising metrics. However, AI-generated accounts designed for positive engagement could redefine user interactions and provide brands with new avenues for targeted marketing. The public's response to these advancements will emerge only when Meta initiates user testing.</p>

<blockquote>""Great! A new audience segment for Brands to target!"" commented Edward Omeara from MediaHound, suggesting optimism about the prospects for brand engagement.</blockquote>

<p>As Meta continues to push the frontiers of social automation, the traditional dynamics of friend-based communities on social media may undergo a profound transformation, guiding platforms toward an AI-enhanced future.</p>

<h2>OpenAI Board Weighs Special Voting Rights to Thwart Elon Musk Takeover</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
OpenAI is reportedly considering the implementation of special voting rights for its nonprofit board as a defensive measure against an unsolicited takeover bid from tech entrepreneur Elon Musk. According to a report by the Financial Times, this strategic move aims to ensure the board retains control over the organization's future, especially as OpenAI transitions into a for-profit entity.

<h3>Proposed Governance Mechanisms</h3>
Citing sources familiar with the discussions, the Financial Times reports that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and other board members are evaluating numerous governance strategies in anticipation of the company's shift to a for-profit model. One significant proposal includes granting the nonprofit board ""outsized voting power"" to maintain its decisive influence over the restructured company. This would empower the board to counteract hostile takeover attempts, including those by outsiders such as Musk, and other investors like Microsoft and SoftBank.

<h3>Background and Elon Musk's Offer</h3>
Elon Musk, alongside a consortium of investors, recently made a $97.4 billion offer to acquire OpenAI. Altman promptly rejected the proposition, stating that ""OpenAI is not for sale"" and accusing Musk of being a competitor who cannot outcompete OpenAI in the market. The OpenAI board unanimously voted to decline the offer.

<h3>Alternative Defensive Strategies</h3>
Another measure under consideration is the potential deployment of a ""poison pill"" strategy or shareholder rights plan. This would allow shareholders to purchase additional shares at a discount to fend off hostile takeovers. While a poison pill was successfully employed by Twitter's board in a similar situation with Musk, OpenAI's board has yet to decide whether to pursue this tactic.

<h3>OpenAI's Transition and Musk's Legal Challenge</h3>
OpenAI, originally founded as a nonprofit in 2015, established a ""capped profit"" entity in 2019 to balance its financial and social missions. As plans progress to transition to a public benefit corporation, the nonprofit arm is set to retain shares and continue supporting charitable initiatives in sectors such as healthcare, education, and science. Musk has legally challenged this conversion, seeking to block the transition to a for-profit structure. Special voting rights for the nonprofit board could potentially address these concerns regarding the organization's mission and governance.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
The developments at OpenAI reflect ongoing tensions between preserving the original mission of creating AI for the benefit of humanity and navigating the commercial pressures of a for-profit model. As the board contemplates new governance structures, the impact on OpenAI's strategic direction and the broader AI landscape remains to be seen.

Despite assurances in May about its development, insiders revealed a lack of prioritization internally, raising questions about the company's commitment to addressing copyright concerns. The Media Manager aimed to alleviate some criticism and shield OpenAI from intellectual property lawsuits, as it battles class-action suits from artists and media conglomerates claiming unauthorized use of their work in AI models. While OpenAI currently offers limited opt-out options, creators find them inadequate. Experts question whether even a future rollout of the tool would effectively address legal and ethical issues in AI training, as concerns about fair use and transformative purposes loom large","<h1>OpenAI Misses Deadline for Promised AI Training Opt-Out Tool</h1>

<p>In a significant development in the AI industry, OpenAI has not met its deadline for the delivery of a highly anticipated tool designed to allow content creators to opt out of having their works used in AI training datasets. This delay has sparked concern amidst ongoing debates around intellectual property in the realm of artificial intelligence.</p>

<h2>Background: A Promise Unfulfilled</h2>

<p>In May 2024, OpenAI announced the development of a tool named Media Manager, intended to empower creators to specify how their works could be included or excluded from AI training data sources. This tool was expected to mitigate the risk of proprietary infringements and reduce criticism from creators and legal professionals regarding AI model training practices.</p>

<blockquote>""Media Manager was to be a comprehensive solution to manage content preferences related to AI training datasets,"" a former OpenAI employee remarked. ""However, it simply wasn't prioritized internally."" </blockquote>

<h3>An Internal Perspective</h3>

<p>Reports indicate that the project encountered internal challenges, contributing to its delay. Key figures involved in the development and legal aspects of Media Manager have transitioned to different roles or left the company, further complicating progress.</p>

<h2>Industry Reaction: Legal and Creative Concerns</h2>

<p>The absence of an efficient opt-out option has led to mounting tension between AI developers and content creators. Legal disputes have intensified, with artists, authors, and media entities pursuing class-action lawsuits against OpenAI for allegedly unauthorized use of copyrighted material in training AI models such as ChatGPT and Sora.</p>

<blockquote>Adrian Cyhan, an intellectual property attorney, stated, ""The introduction of Media Manager was seen as crucial for addressing the challenging intersection of IP law and AI technology. Without it, legal complexities persist.""</blockquote>

<h3>The Broader Implications</h3>

<p>Despite OpenAI's ongoing attempts to address these issues through piecemeal solutions — such as opt-out forms and web-scraping limitations — many creators find these efforts insufficient. They argue that without a streamlined, robust mechanism, their rights remain inadequately protected.</p>

<h2>The Long Road Ahead</h2>

<p>While OpenAI has not provided a definitive timeline for the release of the Media Manager, the pressure remains high. The ongoing delay suggests the company's attempt to balance innovation in AI technology with ethical considerations and compliance with existing legal frameworks remains a formidable task.</p>

<blockquote>Ed Newton-Rex, founder of Fairly Trained, commented, “The burden of responsibility should not fall solely on creators to protect their works. OpenAI must strive to integrate more comprehensive and accessible solutions.”</blockquote>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

In the continually evolving fields of automation and artificial intelligence, ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real Physics) is emerging as a breakthrough framework set to revolutionize the agility and coordination of humanoid robots. By addressing the complex challenges posed by the dynamics mismatch between simulation environments and real-world physics, ASAP facilitates the learning of agile, whole-body skills in humanoid robots, enhancing their potential to perform human-like tasks with unprecedented precision and efficiency.

<h3>Background and Challenges</h3>

The ability of humanoid robots to replicate agile and coordinated human motions has been hindered by inadequacies in existing methodologies such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR). These approaches often require intensive parameter tuning or lead to overly conservative motion policies, limiting the robots' agility. Recognizing these limitations, a team of researchers including Tairan He, Jiawei Gao, Wenli Xiao, and others have pioneered the ASAP framework, aimed at overcoming these barriers.

<h3>The ASAP Framework</h3>

<h4>Motion Tracking Pre-training and Real Trajectory Collection</h4>
The ASAP framework begins by pre-training motion tracking policies using retargeted human motion data within a simulation environment. This step is crucial for generating realistic trajectories that mimic those of real-world scenarios.

<h4>Delta Action Model Training</h4>
Utilizing the data collected from real-world rollout of these pre-trained policies, the team develops a delta action model. By minimizing the discrepancy between the states of simulation (s_t) and real-world (s^r_t), this model is designed to rectify the dynamics mismatch, ensuring more accurate emulation of real-world conditions in simulations.

<h4>Policy Fine-tuning</h4>
Following the delta action model training, the model is integrated into the simulator. This integration allows for fine-tuning of the existing motion tracking policies, further aligning them with real-world physics, thus enhancing their agility and coordination.

<h4>Real-World Deployment</h4>
After fine-tuning, the optimized policy is deployed directly in the real world. Remarkably, this deployment omits the delta action model, relying entirely on the refined policies to execute agile motions akin to those observed in human athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo and LeBron James.

<h3>Evaluation and Outcomes</h3>

The ASAP framework's efficiency was tested across various transfer scenarios including IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to a real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. The results indicated substantial improvements in agility and coordination over existing methodologies like SysID and DR, with notable reductions in tracking errors. The framework supports agile motions such as side jumps and forward kicks, proving its effectiveness.

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

ASAP demonstrates a significant leap forward in the field of humanoid robotics, seamlessly bridging the gap between simulation and real-world dynamics. Its success paves a promising path for future developments in the sim-to-real transfer of agility and expressive capability in humanoids. With these advancements, humanoid robots are poised to assume more complex roles across diverse applications, transforming industries through enhanced automation and AI integration.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/672916ba596e9ad764eea6e4/67a38f7ef94f1b095e40350d_tmp4z3fpiqd.png,,agile.human2humanoid.com,Wed Feb 05 2025 17:18:48 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),,"A visually stunning main image for the article: RESEARCH: ""ASAP: Revolutionizing Humanoid Robots with Real-World Agility"""

Furthermore, the group is alleged to have financed US-based companies to sustain the AI server and facilitate a sprawling network of at least 100 websites instrumental in executing their campaign.</p>

<h3>Manipulation of Political Content</h3>

<p>The Russian entity is also implicated in the dissemination of manipulated video content. One such video allegedly contained spurious allegations against a vice-presidential candidate in the 2024 election. This video, aimed at damaging the reputation of Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, Tim Walz, highlights the lengths to which these organizations have gone to influence the electoral process.</p>

<h2>Iranian Influence and Cyber Interference</h2>

<p>Simultaneously, the Treasury Department has sanctioned the Cognitive Design Production Center, an affiliate of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). This organization has been under scrutiny for its intentions to interfere with the election since at least 2023. In a related development, the US Department of Justice indicted several Iranian nationals, accusing them of orchestrating a cyberattack on President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign.</p>

<h3>Broader Implications and AI Involvement</h3>

<p>The indictments coincided with OpenAI's move to block ChatGPT accounts that were traced back to an Iranian influence operation, further attesting to the pervasive threat posed by AI-enabled disinformation strategies. These developments underscore the necessity for vigilance and sophisticated countermeasures in protecting democratic processes from aberrant international influence.</p>

<blockquote>""The Governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,"" stated Bradley Smith, Acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence.</blockquote>

<p>This statement encapsulates the broader challenge faced by nations in safeguarding the integrity of their electoral systems against technologically advanced disinformation efforts. It highlights the critical need for expertise in automation, AI, and process mapping, areas in which Jengu.ai excels, to develop robust defenses against such complex threats.</p>
